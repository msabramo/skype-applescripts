Skype AppleScripts
==========================================

These are some AppleScripts that I developed to make it easier to dial into a
daily conference call. For this conference call, I dial into an 888 number and
then I dial an 8 digit conference code and hit the '#' key to enter a
particular conference. Surprisingly, Skype doesn't let you do this in a simple
way by adding something like ",,12345678#" to the phone number, so I had to
resort to scripting.

These AppleScripts do not work with Skype 8. They might work on Skype 7.

```
brew cask uninstall skype
brew cask install skype7
```

SkypeDialer.applescript provides core services that can be used by other
AppleScripts, including SkypeDialerGUI. You should open SkypeDialer.applescript
with AppleScript Editor and then save it as a stay-open application
(File | Save As... and then for the File Format, select "Application" and in
Options, make sure that "Stay Open" is checked). I saved mine in /Applications
so I have /Applications/Skype Dialer.app.

SkypeDialerGUI can be used as a regular script or an application.
